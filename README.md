# USELESS WANDERER üéØ


## Basic Details

### Team Name: Vazha

### Team Members

‚Ä¢ Team Lead: Harikrishnan B - College of Engineering Trivandrum 

‚Ä¢ Member 2: Abhijeet Nair - College of Engineering Trivandrum 

‚Ä¢ Member 3: Anusreya Ganesh- College of Engineering Trivandrum 

### Project Description

Our project is basically a misleading navigator that takes the used anywhere but the given destination and utilises the user's time with as many detours as possible. Your final destination might be close but never where you intended to go. Be sure to use our app if you have too much time on your hands!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

The Useless Wanderer solves the problem of not being able to traverse the longest route between your start and final destination!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Our app gives you the most unnecessary detours and that too in way too many numbers until you reach your destination which will surely not be the one you actually wanted to go!
